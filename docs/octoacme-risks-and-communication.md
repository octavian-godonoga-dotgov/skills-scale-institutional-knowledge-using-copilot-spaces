# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support, Sponsor/Executive Stakeholders)
- Tailor communication frequency and detail based on stakeholder role
- Provide regular updates (weekly for team/PM, monthly or milestone-based for executives)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Engage Business Analyst for requirements clarification with stakeholders
- Ensure Technical Writer prepares external-facing communications when needed

## Communication Templates

Incident Communication
- Triage summary
- Actions being taken
- Expected timeline
- Post-incident blameless retrospective scheduled

## Escalation Paths
- Team-level -> PM -> Product Lead -> Sponsor/Executive Stakeholder
- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call
- For significant scope or timeline changes, engage Sponsor/Executive Stakeholder early
- For requirements conflicts, involve Business Analyst to facilitate resolution
